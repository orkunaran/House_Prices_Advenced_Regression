## About the Repository

This repository includes my analysis on predicting house prices of [Ames House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The repository includes 2 notebooks;

1. Data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, Feature engineering and selection, Visualizations
2. Comparison of different machine learning models and  Hyperparameter tuning on the best model

## About the Data
The dataset consists of 79 variables to predict the prices. The detailed description of the data can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data?select=data_description.txt)

### Scoring Metric

Because this is a Kaggle learning competation, Kaggle chosed an evaluation metric: 
    "Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)"

## Models and Results

My approach to the dataset was able to get a RMSE score of 0.13204 which placed me at 4311th place from 13447 competitors. As a beginner and self-taught data enthusiast, this was my first regression analysis (probably 3rd or 4th data analysis with ML).  I learnt a lot by doing this kaggle, and had lots of fun doing it. I hope I could transfer my joy to the notebook, and made it fun and easier to read for you guys. 

Thank you for your time.
